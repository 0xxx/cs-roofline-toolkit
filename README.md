# CS Roofline Toolkit #

Welcome to the CS Roofline Toolkit Bitbucket site.  The Empirical Roofline
Tool is currently available here.  In the future additional tools will be
hosted here.

## Empirical Roofline Tool ##

The Empirical Roofline Tool, ERT, automatically generates a roofline data
for a given computer.  This includes the maximum bandwidth for the various
levels of the memory hierarchy and the maximum gflop rate.  This data is
obtained using a variety of "micro-kernels".

The ERT comes with a set of configuration files for a number of
computers/architectures.  These configuration file can be adapted to your
local environment and needs to better measure the roofline parameters of
your computer(s).
